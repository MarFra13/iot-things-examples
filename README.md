The examples currently on cover some selected aspects of the functionality and do not provide a full overview of the possibilites. If you want to learn more please look at the provided background information or get in contact with us.

### Example "mini-device-integration"

This example shows how to create a minimal device integration example that uses the Things Client for managing your first thing.

### Example "mini-webui"

This example shows how to create a simple web user interface to display your first thing.

### Example "inventory-browser"

This example shows how to create a simple user interface to list things and their details and show the things on a map.

Integrated into the inventory-browser examples are two more examples "device-simulator" and "historian".

### Example "device-simulator"

This example implements a simple web application to simulate a device by using a sensor information of a modern mobile phone/tablet.

### Example "historian"

This example shows how to collect and use data history of property values.
It shows how to collect and store the data in a MongoDB, how to make them accessible via REST and how to present them in a time series chart.

### Example "postman-collection"

This is a list of prepared REST call examples to demonstrate typical usages of the REST APIs.

The provided files can be used in Google Chrome browser extension "Postman". This extension can be downloaded here: <https://www.getpostman.com/>

### Example "things-client-examples"

This example shows how to use the upcoming of the Things Client for Java.

### Example "things-http-java-examples"

This example shows how to use the HTTP API within Java using the Signature Authentication.

### Example "openid-jwt-login"

### Example "openid-browser-automation"

Example application to automate a browser-based login for a _Bosch Account_ to get OpenId Connect JWT token without human interaction.

## Preparation for Java Developers

### Maven Repository

In order to be able to run the examples (or to implement your own), you need the "Bosch IoT Things - Things Client".
This is available via our public Maven repository. Add following Maven-Repository to your Maven `settings.xml`:

```
   ..
   <repositories>
      <repository>
         <id>bosch-releases</id>
         <url>https://maven.bosch-si.com/content/repositories/bosch-releases/</url>
         <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy>
         </releases>
         <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>daily</updatePolicy>
         </snapshots>
      </repository>
      ..
   </repositories>
   ..
```

### Maven Dependency

After adding the public repository as described above, you can simply use the Things Client dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.bosch.iot.things</groupId>
   <artifactId>things-client</artifactId>
   <version>3.0.0.RC9</version>
</dependency>
```

We also provide an OSGi-bundle:

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.bosch.iot.things</groupId>
      <artifactId>things-client-osgi</artifactId>
   <version>3.0.0.RC9</version>
</dependency>
```
